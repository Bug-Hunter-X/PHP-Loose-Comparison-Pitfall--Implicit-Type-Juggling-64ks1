In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with string comparisons involving loosely typed variables.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$value = "10";
if ($value == 10) {  // Loose comparison
  echo "Values are equal";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal";
}
```

Here, the loose comparison (`==`) allows type juggling. PHP will implicitly convert the string "10" to an integer 10 before comparison, resulting in a true condition.  This behavior might lead to unexpected results if strict type checking is required.
