The solution lies in employing strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison demands that both the value and type of the operands are identical.

```php
$value = "10";
if ($value === 10) {  // Strict comparison
  echo "Values are equal";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal";
}
```

Now, the condition will evaluate to false because the types are different (string vs. integer), providing the expected and consistent behavior.
